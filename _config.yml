# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Os Musiadas is a play on words, combining the Portuguese epic poem
  Os Lusiadas with "muse" taken from the Odyssey of Homer. This website is
  a collection of creative and technical writings on subjects which
  interest me. 

baseurl: "/os-musiadas" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
