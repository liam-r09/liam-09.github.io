The meaning of things change when the frame of reference changes.

The "Ein Shtein" might have made this realization, and the mathematical
description of the universe he created is said to formally describe this
idea.  

But nary is the goal to explore ideas of 'fogies such as this, and nor am 
I in a position to adequately offer critiques or refutations. I stand 
unqualified and unexperienced to speak on matters physics, it would be 
as if you were to ask a fly to describe an ice cream cone at a county fair.  

It's a neat idea though, and probably explains why the engineering-minded
person differs from the physics or theology minded-person.

Same old story, Plato breaking chairs in his house, throwing liquor bottles
at Aristotle, demanding for the repairs which he could otherwise not accomplish.
Heraclitus enters the ring, setting Democritus' house on fire. Daring the lad to
deal with the issue. "Betcha a nickel, get some water from the river 
der 'bhy, but she's 'a gotta be from the same place is the catch".
Democritus laughs, knowing that the old manichean set the governor's house on fire instead.    
Hence, is the world driven by the never ending conflict of opposites, or was Homer
right when he said make love not war? 

Recently, (recently) Alfred North Whitehead spoke on the concept of a 'fallacy of 
misapplied concreteness'. Truly calling the whole "#shebang!" into question. 

In "Science and The Modern World" he's pushing the idea that viewing
the world as a clock, taking it apart like a machinist and fixing 'er
good only cuts the mustard for a few of the buns.

That maybe the use of a mechanistic or materialistic scheme of viewing 
the world might only be a good idea some of the time, but not all of the time. 

The great war between the Ein Sof and the Ein Shtein, the scholar and 
the engineer, "Shem the penman" and "Shaun the postman" will keep 'a blazin'
until the very end of time. Or at least until we take a side (A STANCE).   

If your attention span hasn't been disrupted by the various examples of 
circumstantial/tangential/schizophrenia-adjacent ramblings, you might 
have been able to discern which side of the fence of the issue i've chosen
to occupy.  

When the medical profession speaks of the malign nature of a pathogen,
the extreme and abstract view would tend to support the assumption 
that this malign creature be eradicated and removed.  

Not to serve as an advocate for the well-being of tapeworms, but 
[a couple of folios would seem to suggest](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/11/4/1200 ) 
that in the context of inflammatory bowel disease, maybe the 
critters could help sufferers save a few pennies on their -mAb or -cept of choice.
(definitely not to be taken as medical advice)  

As an important aside, I need to assert that any sympathy for worms
only extends to those that perish in the Chesapeake bay every year as a
consequence of the recurrent hypoxia. May we take a moment of silence to 
remember [the thousands of pounds of worms and clams estimated to 
 die every year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay#Pollution)
in the Chesapeake bay.     

Back to the argument: 

(to be read with a newfoundlander brogue)

"There 'a once was an antibiotic called -penem,
whose effect was to wreck your esteem of 'em
take some cilastatin as well
to avoid going to hell
but you've gotta have some mighty respect for 'em

It confounds understanding as to why the older and younger generations
are hermetically sealed from one another. 

The often censored "common sense" maybe understood in an anthropological 
context as "traditional knowledge of the elders" has always been 
an esteemed source of knowledge in traditional societies.  

The idea of using medications with known toxic side-effects 
as a last resort seems to me a reasonable approach. 
Reserving them for cases where the obvious benefits
overshadow any drawbacks also appear to have a basis. 
It comes to me as no surprise that a medication forged 
in a era where common-sense was all that one had, 
still carries the vestigial use-case hierarchy.

If they were an internal organ, maybe the "-penems" would represent
the appendix, only to be taken in the event that something 
really bad is about to happen.  

Without making reference to any downright stupid practice 
guidelines in effect to this very day, we can ask the question
as to whether or not the fallacy of misplaced concreteness 
bears any relevance to the practice or theory of medicine.  

A purely empirical approach may lack guidance if it lacks 
any theoretical basis (think Guyton's Textbook), but relying
solely on the latter approach may cause one to miss the mark entirely. 

This old 'common-sense' approach is much like viewing things 
as a heuristic. On one hand, if the heuristic fails to change
with the times, you get an ossified, mothball-stinking approach
reminiscent of the Radiothor snake oil. On the other hand,
if the approach is excessively empirical, no abstractions 
used to describe things approaching 'truth' can be derived. 
Take the controversy regarding aspirin as an example. 

One group would lead you to believe that it causes catastrophic
bleeds, while also stating that its use is negligible for pulmonary 
embolisms. 

A medication almost as old as time whose mechanism of action is 
pretty much only understood to include platelet aggregation inhibition,
COX-inhibition, LOX-inhibition, and acetylation of proteins (something-something).
