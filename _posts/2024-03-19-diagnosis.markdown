If one happens to be paying attention, patterns emerge regarding the way that institutions choose to organize themselves. 
The educational hierarchy, for instance, is stratified on the basis of progressive pathways. What begins as an acquisition 
of standard knowledge, evolves into various acquisitions of specialized knowledge. During this journey one surpasses 
benchmarks, and acquiring 'degrees' or endorsements of specialized knowledge once either transcended or established.

This sort of 'rite of passage' progression can be seen in the corporate, academic, skilled labour, medical and governmental hierarchies. 
Entry into one institution for a period of training may require that one complete a certain set of pre-requisites prior to 
becoming a neophyte in one of these other schools of life. 

Take the medical hierarchy for example, it requires the trainee to pass through various academic and pre-academic benchmarks 
prior to admission into the fold. Maybe you've gotta volunteer in a soup kitchen or save the whales for a week or two. 

Graduation lends a degree of credibility. It yields the right to generate language to serve a specific social purpose. 
In this case, the medi-cian can dispense a 'diagnosis' to one who has self-identified being ill or sick. 
(No need to get into the discussion of the [sick role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_role) that's been done by
those committed to the [grave sin of sociology](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/harper-on-terror-arrests-not-a-time-for-sociology-1.1413502).

##Philological Nonsense

According to the etymological dictionary, [diagignōskein](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=diagnosis) took place of 
diagnosis, or more Greek-ly 'diagnose' (διάγνωση). 

However, this type of antiquated form of analysis fails to provide any degree of clarity. If such an approach is warranted 
under any circumstances, it should be to clarify rather than to obscure. Maybe teachers/professors should read that one again.

The prefix dia- tends to mean [through, between or thoroughly.](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=dia-) 
Gnosis on the other hand, when not used as a suffix has a whole other set of associations. 
The word [gnosis](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=gnosis) could be understood to refer to knowledge in general. 
However, when placed in an another setting, the suffix betrays all manner of associations with hidden or obscure knowledge. 
When taken together, a new meaning emerges which differs from that which we traditionally understand to be the dispensing of labels. 
Instead of a label to enlighten of ones individual pathology, the "dia-gnosis" means something like "to travel through, thoroughly
hidden knowledge". 

The journey can be one which harms, or one which is [helpful if delivered properly](https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article/5/4/302/6386019?login=false)

Maybe cotrasting sophia [or divine wisdom](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=sophia) with a [sophist](https://www.etymonline.com/word/sophist) 
might give us an idea of how these ideas as expressed through words develop. 
The extent to which etymology contributes to our anthropology is another question alltogether, but it is certainly an interesting
observation. 

The relation between sophia and sophist shows that at some point, hidden or sacred knowledge became a dumpster fire 
with lawyers and all, which might lead us to conclude that either a relation exists between the two, or it may turn out to be a crock of shit. 

Hence the language, or the symbol, leads us down the path towards the most abstract or universal fulfillment of its meaning. 
It betrays that there exists a similarity, perhaps, between the way that people acquire specialized knowledge, and ways
which hidden or occult knowledge is to be acquired. Certain fraternal organizations, for example, also require that 
their 'trainees' engage in certain activities, study up, in order to acquire specialized knowledge and accumulate 
degrees. Definitely a questionable association. 

Much like the various institutions, there is a differentiation, or hierarchy between the various members. Some happen to 
be further along in the process, and it would be foolish, according to them, that all those undergoing the transformation 
are at the same level of development. 

Maybe it would be a faux-pas to consider a resident to be on the same level as a pre-medical student. Yeah probably. 

##Signs of a secret society

In school there are school uniforms. Doctors and nurses have specialized clothings. Don't even get me started on the
surgeons. What about a cook, 'officer of the law', fire fighter, professional 'student' or profess-or? 

The presence of differentiation, as well as commonality cannot be used alone to lead us to a conclusion that 
a secret society might be behind all of these things. Such thinking betrays some kind of pathological paranoia. 

The aim, on the other hand, is to consider the idea that such structures and progressions in society happen to
mirror how secret societies choose to structure themselves.  

Each of these groups contains specialized knowledge as well. Don't believe me? 
Never heard of trade secrets? 
I'd like to see YOU build a big 'ol ziggurat with nothing more than a bowl of oatmeal and a handfull of sand. 

Do you think those DIY books will tell you all you need to know about turning your basement furnace into a 
DIY garbage incinerator? 

I think not.

What George Carlin called [spooky language](https://youtu.be/sk81tUUhRig?si=OliOCHLgJ2fELSez&t=120) is worthy of mention.
It denotes a set of terminology created by a ruling class, perhaps serving to obscure, in order to facilitate control 
of people or elicit compliance. Think of all of the fancy words used by doctors, scientists, lawyers, and any others 
who subjected themselves to their respective rites of passage. 

##Regulation by self-governing 'committees'

Implicit in the idea of secrecy, is that the affairs cannot be managed except by those in the 'cool kids club'. 
The elect need to appoint elders, in infinite wisdom, to judge the conduct of its members.

Probably there's something in there about keeping things under wraps, excluding the muggles from any understanding.
Binding the purpose to protecting the public, reputation management, keeping the peace. A whole other discussion can 
begin in this case, as to whether or not much can be said about the [role and value of hierarchy in general.](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-ship-of-fools)

Take a moment to think about how many institutions display this kind of internal structure. 

Maybe labor organizations, political organizations, law enforcement groups, health and education. 
It might be easier to begin a discussion on finding the institutions lacking this self-regulatory character.
