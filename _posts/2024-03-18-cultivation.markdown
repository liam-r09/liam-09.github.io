Were it not for the bravery of its subjects, such sneaky things might 
[never see the light of day.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/mk-ultra-class-action-lawsuit-u-s-immunity-in-canada-1.6985475)

I can't imagine that many Canadians would even believe that such things
took place in the true north strong and free. 

It would not be the only such case [in Canadian history unfortunately.](http://www.thepsychopathmachine.com/)

Having an iota of critical thinking, or harboring a skeptical attitude would
lead one to discredit such stories or events. And under normal circumstances, 
such an attitude would be justified. 

But it certainly does give a whole new layer of meaning to the legendary scenes in 
Stanley Kubrick's film "A Clockwork Orange".

Along with "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", such films or books serve to illustrate the
prevailing views of the time regarding the nature of "mental-health-care(TM)" in North America.

Subsequently, the process of "de-institutionalization" featured the closing of psychiatric
hospitals and facilities. The approach was portrayed as a socially constructed space which 
would cultivate the qualities of mental illness amongst those unfortunate enough to be hospitalized. 

The view clearly lacks subtlety, and something to this effect has been advocated by people such as 
Thomas Szasz or Ivan Illich more broadly. Both arguing, in a broad sense, that institutions can 
fail to fulfill fundamantal roles when they get to a certain size, or relegate to themselves
certain powers.
