Analogy is a useful device serving to permit us to connect seemingly 
unrelated subjects or activities to one another. 

By making use of something which is known, in other words, possessing 
a series of sensory inputs corresponding with an experience, it can 
facilitate the understanding of the abstract, or unknowable things.

Take voltage for instance. Nary can it be seen or smelled. Maybe in the
event that an arc occurs (under the circumstances of very high voltage)
it might be visualized as an arc (think of a plasma ball).

The ionizing of air can produce ozone permitting a smell to emerge
(think of the smell of certain printers in offices, or maybe the stink
of an arc welder if you 'aint the officing type). 

So under extreme conditions, perhaps we have a frame of reference 
by which to understand voltage (many thanks to the lads who made 
those reference points understandable). 

But under most other citcumstances, it cannot be seen, smelled, and 
I suspect that if you were to get a shock by accident, you might not 
be able to distinguish voltage from current by feel alone (although
I could be wrong, it's not the experiment i'm apt to suspect 
dingbatters will be willing to enjoy). 

Water under pressure has been used to illustrate the concept of voltage,
with the electrons (or 'electricity') representing the water, voltage
the pressure. 

Hene the unknown becomes knowable. 

With our newfound powers of abstraction we can now tackle the question 
of how one an determine the number of weevils one could detect in any 
particular snickers bar. 

A much more practical endeavor than the never ending search for the 
'dark matter' or 'black hole' whereby something is defined by it's negation.

If it were theology, it would be called apophatic. If it were a cloudy day
it would be described in terms of the sun's absence, if it were a soup 
it would be described by its absence of gluten, meats, sodium, or nutrition.
