The study of the human immune system is fraught with divisions to better
facilitate its understanding. Despite being laden with terminology, 
these distinctions can provide for an appreciation for how the human
immune system works.  

A distinction is made between the cells which participate in an immune response
(so-called cellular immunity) and proteins (called humoral immunity) which
take part in the immune response. 

Another distinction is made between the adaptive and innate immune system, 
The latter refers to a general set of responses which only vary in intensity
in response to an externally challenging agent. Adaptive responses will
involve developing a more specific response to the offending agent. 

Both adaptive and innate responses can include both cellular and humoral
participants, as will be elaborated.

The innate immune system is thought to be very old, as several aspects 
are shared between humans and other so-called lower organisms. 

The participants in this great and complex dance includes
the toll-like receptors, natural killer cells, serum complement proteins
macrophages and for sake of completeness, cytokines. 

## <u>Toll-Like Receptors</u>

If you didn't get enough of the classification schemes, don't worry,
more certainly will suffice to explain these receptors appropriately. 

A major division which exists between higher and lower organisms exists
at the microscopic level. The basis of these distinctions are on which 
components of cellular machinery are present, or on how these components
are organized. This division is between the higher organisms (eukaryotes)
and the lower organisms (prokaryotes). The former includes most higher 
animals, and the latter includes only microscopic organisms. A major 
exception to consider is that fungi are eukaryotes, even though they 
are microorganisms.

It is thought that through the years of interaction between these organisms
various eukaryotes developed a common set of means of defending themselves
against insult by the prokaryotic organisms. 

Receptors are often understood in terms of a lock and key mechanism. 
When the 'key' (antigen) binds to its lock (receptor) a chain reaction 
begins inside of the cell, resulting in a series of changes. 

In the case of toll-like receptors, this binding leads to the release of 
proteins called cytokines. The cytokines are proteins which lead to a change
in the physiology of the organism to whom the toll-like receptors belong,

Much as was the case in Sudbury Ontario in the earlier parts of this century,
the eukaryotic solution to an 'invading' prokayote can be understood as follows:
The solution to pollution is dilution. 

The cytokines citculate throughout the body and bind to various receptors 
all located at various points in the body. The resulting effect is that 
blood vessels dilate immensely, and the heart rate increases to accomodate
the major expansion in blood volume. 

The antigen, or keys used in the abovementioned analogy, are typically
substances which almost never occur within a human mammal under normal 
circumstances. This would include things pieces taken from the surface
of a bacteria (also called endotoxin) a fungus, or fragments of genetic
material which tend not to occur under normal circumstances (for instance,
double-stranded RNA).

Each toll-like receptor, and if I remember correctly, there are up to eight 
of them, binds to a specific piece of an alien organism, resulting in the
same general response. 

## <u>Complement</u> 

One of the things which these cytokines do in addition to causing blood 
vessels to dilate, is to faciliate the production of a set of proteins 
called 'Complement'. 

These complement proteins can act to eliminate an invading pathogen by 
causing their membranes to break, destroying their respective abilities to
maintain structural integrity. 

I have the greatest respect for Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi who had initially 
put in so much work to discover this sequence of events, especially 
considering not only how complex the "complement-cascade" but also 
how painful I know committing the process to memory happens to be. 

## <u>Natural Killer (NK) Cells</u>

An often forgotten player in the innate immune response, these cells 
serve to move around the body, interacting with bodily cells as they pass
by. In an unflattering way, these cells send a chemical signal, again
with cytokines to ask the bodily cells to show the natural killer cell
if they have any infections inside of them. The body cells will respond
by showing their hands, and if the hand contains a piece of an alien 
invader, the natural killer cell will destroy the infected cell. 

A bit of a simplified explanation, in actuality they check the major 
histocompatibility molecule for any signs of structural issues which may 
indicate a tumor, or fragments of invaders which obviously indicates infection.

I'll be sure to share some more details about this process when we get 
into the specific details of a process, for now it's best to get the big
picture. 

## <u>Macrophages</u>

These cells are varied, and can be found all over the place in the body.
They even can change form, and 'terminally' differentiate into forms that
best accomodate their living space in certain tissues. 

For example, a macrophage can change its form and turn into what is called
a dendritic cell in the skin, and basically live there, looking for 
strange things to eat.

And that's more or less what these things do. They are called phages from
the Greek 'phagos' probably based on the observation that they respond 
to invaders by eating them. Another example would be the dust cell, which 
is just a macrophage which lives in the lungs. I speculate that the name
came from the observation that these cells may internalize the dust or 
cigarette smoke that they may encounter as a cosequence of choosing to 
live there. 

It would seem that housing markets can have effects which none of us 
can really anticipate. 

## <u>Cytokines</u>

Broadly speaking, this would include chemicals which lead to a specific 
effect serving to enhance immune function. This might include producing
substances to help wil clotting, dilating blood vessels, recruiting cells
to a specifically damaged area, or production of complement proteins.

This would include what are called interleukins (IL) which, much like the
toll like receptors are too numerous to list, but will be covered when it
is relevant. 

In any case, it is important not to forget the innate immune system for 
the following reasons.

In the case when the innate immune system is activated excessively, a medical
condition called "sepsis" takes place. It has been called blood poisoning, 
but in actual fact represents an excessive activation of the innate immune
system to the infecting organism. This typically results when a local infection
spreads to the bloodstream.

In the case of transplants, it is relevant because natural killer cells will 
recognize that the transplanted organ is from another person, and will respond 
by destroying it if it isn't similar enough to the host. 

That's the whole relevance to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
bit alluded to earlier.

Some have spoken anecdotally about a 'division' of the immune system which
is responsible for eliminating cancers if they were to arise. This is 
correct, and also represents one of the major functions of natural killer 
cells. If they detect any signs of malignant cells, they will basically 
eliminate it right then and there. 

Of course, begging the question as to whether or not immune suppression 
plays a role in the 'cancerization' process.

Finally, the existence of the innate immune system implies its counterpart
the adaptive immune system. It would seem, therefore, that under certain
circumstances, the immune system does not need training (and produce 
consequently produce antibodies) to eliminate a pathogen from the body, 
although it definitely helps. 

An appropriate understanding of the immune system can help to determine 
the best technologies to assist it, in the event that things go wrong.
