Hi, my name is Liam. I wrote this website using Jekyll in order to learn 
about using new technologies. 

My hope for this blog is first and foremost, a writing exercise for myself.
Secondarily, I hope that it represents a source of interesting information
for readers who share the same interests as myself. 

The content is centered around various biomedical issues, but may also 
touch on unrelated subjects like engineering, mathematics, construction,
and politics.
